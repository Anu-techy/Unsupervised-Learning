**Unsupervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data without labeled outputs.
That means: the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the data on its own.

**Common Types of Unsupervised Learning:**

Clustering	--------- Groups similar data points together	-- Customer segmentation (e.g., K-Means)

Dimensionality Reduction	-------    Reduces the number of features while keeping patterns ------------	Data visualization (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)

Anomaly Detection	----------- Finds unusual data points	-------- Fraud detection, network intrusions

Association Rule Mining	--------     Discovers relationships between items	-------  Market basket analysis (e.g., Apriori)

**Types of Algorithms**

K-Means	-- Clustering

DBSCAN	-- Clustering

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) --	Dimensionality Reduction

t-SNE	--  Dimensionality Reduction (visualization)

Apriori / FP-Growth	--  Association Rules

Isolation Forest	--  Anomaly Detection
